# Matrix multiplication using AVX2, OpenMP

## Version1

I just organized and packaged the previous results.

- Matrix multiplication
- Create random matrix
- Create incresing matrix
- Transpse a matrix

## Version2

I rewrite the codes in CPP and organize, packaged it again. Then I add the optmized dotproduct codes from [Prof.Yu's class](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/CPP/tree/main/week08/examples) and use them in my matrix multiplication functions. 

Then I run a test and the test result hs here.
